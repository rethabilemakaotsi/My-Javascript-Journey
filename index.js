// STEP1.   Make sure to create a repo called "My Javascript Journey" and link this folder with that repository.
//          You should not have any issues, if you are having issues, go back to the git note or ask your friend 
//          before asking your lecturer for help.(You cannot forget git commands)
// STEP2.   Every push to github must be to a branch and a pull request has to be made to merge the branch with main. 
//          Any pushes to main will result in you having to restart from the beginning(from creating a repo).
// STEP3.   Follow the order : 1 create repo, 2 run all commands necessary to link these to folders, 
//          3 create and work on branch, 4 push branch and use a pull request to merge. 5 PULL YOUR CODE TO LOCAL REPO BEFORE CREATING ANOTHER BRANCH
// STEP4.   You must link this javascript file to an index.html page, taking FOLDER STRUCTURE into consideration.

//INTO TO JAVASCRIPT EXERCISE

// A. TASK 1:VARIABLES and OPERATORS
// 1. Create a variable called “language” and assign it the value “JavaScript”. Then create
// a variable called “score” and assign it the value “10”.

let language = 'javaScript'
console.log(language)
let score = 10
console.log(score)

// 2.Create two variables called “length” and “width”. Assign each variable a value of 10 and 5 respectfully. Use
let length = 10;
let width = 5;
let area = length*width;
console.log(`the area of rectangle is ${length*width}`)
// the variables to calculate the area of a rectangle with the length and width specified (remember area = length x width).
// Write the following to the console using CONCATENATION and BACKTICKS: 
// “The area of the rectangle is …” where … is the area you calculated.

// 3.Create two variables called “num1” and “num2.” Assign each variable a value of 10 and 4 respectfully.
// Calculate and display in the console what the remainder is if num1 is divided by num2.
let numb1 = 10
let numb2 =4
console.log(`the answer is ${numb1/numb2}`)
console.log(`the remainder is ${10%4}`)

// 4.Using the variables you created in the previous step, output the results
// of the division in the following format: “num1 / num2 = x remainder y.” HINT: Backticks
let results = numb1/numb2
let remainder = numb1%numb2
console.log(`numb1/numb2 = ${results} remainder ${remainder}`)



// B. Task 2:Data Types
// 1. Define the following data types with your own contents[ 'integer', 'decimal', 'string', 'array'(minimum: 3 items), 'Object'(minimum: 4 values)]
let variable1 = 100
let variable2 = 3.5656
let variable3 = 'hello world'
let variable4 = [22,'rethabile',false];
// 2. Once you’ve created the variables, display them to the console
console.log(variable1 )
console.log(variable2 )
console.log(variable3 )
console.log(variable4 )

// 3. Use the ‘typeof’ function to check each variable
console.log(typeof variable1)
console.log(typeof variable2)
console.log(typeof variable3)
console.log(typeof variable4)
// 4. Create an array with numbers and strings. Comment what data type you expect this tobe. Then use the ‘typeof’ function on this array
let data =[22,'rethabile']
console.log(typeof data)
// 5. Create a null variable and an undefined variable
let win = null
let car=undefined


// ***********C. Task 3. functions and contional statements************
// N.B. READ WITH UNDERSTANDING!!!
//  1.  Create 3 functions to convert R1000 into dollars, euros and pounds. Take function naming into consideration!
//  2.  Create a function that takes a value and calculates the amount entered including VAT (15%), amount entered should be R400.
//      Then display the message in the console, "The amount after tax is ...".
//  3.  Declare 3 variables 1stNum, 2ndNum, 3rdNum and assign values of 8, 20 and 14 respectfully. Now write a function that compares “num1” and “num2” and 
//      displays the larger value.
//  4.  Write a function that determines whether “num1” is odd or even and displays the
//      result. (Tip: remember the modulus operator %)
//  5.  Next, write a JavaScript conditional statement to sort the three numbers(1stNum, 2ndNum, 3rdNum) from largest to smallest.
